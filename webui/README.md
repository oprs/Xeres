This is the Angular frontend of Xeres.

To upgrade Angular, use https://update.angular.io/ and pray.

And because it breaks all the time, there's no Angular stuff here anymore.
If you want to write a web frontend, feel free to restart it here.

Note that the module is currently removed from the gradle build.
