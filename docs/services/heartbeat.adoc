= Heartbeat
:icons: font

Service type: 6

Sends a ping each 5 seconds.
Can be used to detect if a peer is gone.
Is redundant with the slice probe (1 minute) and RTT (10 seconds).

NOTE: Retroshare sends a heartbeat to all peers every 5 seconds.
If a heartbeat is not received for 100 seconds, it checks if there was traffic and if there wasn't, it assumes the peer is dead.
