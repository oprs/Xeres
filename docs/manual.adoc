First let's start with some paragraph.

I can also have one line in it.

Then I can have paragraph literals

 Like this for example. It's emphasized :)
 And I can continue

NOTE: There are some common tips!

TIP: this is a tip for testing.

IMPORTANT: don't forget that you must do it!

And now: this is some *bold* text, some _italic_ and `monospace` font too.

`{cpp}` is valid syntax.

== And this is a header

And we can have some code examples directly from the source:

[source,java]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/io/xeres/app/crypto/x509/X509Test.java[tag=X509_GenerateCertificate_OK]
----

And another source code:

[source,java]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/io/xeres/app/crypto/rsa/RSATest.java[tag=RSA_GenerateKeys_OK]
----

* [x] this is ok
* [ ] this is not


Source code with callouts:

[source,java]
----
public class TestClass
{
	public void doStuff()
    {
        Foobar foobar = Foobar.generate(); // <1>
        foobar.doThings(); // <2>
        foobar.cleanup(); // <3>
    }
}
----

<1> We start here
<2> Then we do the things
<3> And we clean up
